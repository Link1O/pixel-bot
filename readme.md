# **Pixel ‚≠ê**  
### A Discord bot that does what you actually need

I built Pixel because most bots are either too complicated or missing key features. It handles moderation, utilities, and adds some fun - nothing more, nothing less.

---

## **What it does**  
- **Moderation**: Tools to help manage your server  
- **Utilities**: Practical features for server administration  
- **Entertainment**: Lightweight fun commands  
- **Simple Architecture**: Easy to run and modify (aslong as you have some basic python knowledge) 

#### [Commands list here](https://github.com/Link1O/pixel-bot/blob/main/COMMANDS.md)

## **Roadmap**
Current focus areas:
- **Data storing transition**: Transitioning from JSON to MySQL in some functionalities (JSON files were just for starters)
- **Web interface**: Browser-based control panel
- **Enhanced customization**: More server-specific configuration options
- **Vulnerability hunting**: Looking for vulnerabilities to patch out, increasing the long term reliablility of the bot.
